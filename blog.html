            What is the Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>

            What is difference between global scope and block scope?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords.Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>

            How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>

            What is undefined in JavaScript and what types of undefined in JavaScript ?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>The undefined type belongs to the primitive data types that can have only one value i.e. undefined.
             A variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in the program has a default value of “undefined”.
             types of undefined:1. variable declared but not defined;2. type of an empty string; 3. check if a variable is defined or not;
